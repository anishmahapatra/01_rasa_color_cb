# Anish's Color Bot

## :surfer: Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to showcase a simple color chatbot.

The color chatbot by Anish incorporates concepts of:

- Intents
- Entities
- Stories
- Domain

These are concepts that I shall explain in the [blog series](https://medium.com/@anishmahapatra/the-journey-of-a-building-a-chatbot-part-0-for-smart-noobs-index-ed86790bc976)

## Pre-requisites:
* Make sure your chipset supports TensorFlow (post 2011)
* Ensure Ubuntu Linux System distribution is 64-bit
* Bare Minimum hardware requirement: 4GB; preferable 8GB
* Have a decent chipset so that your system does not struggle
* Intent to learn :)
